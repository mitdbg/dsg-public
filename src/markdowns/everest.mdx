New foundation models like LLMs and other generative AI (GenAI) models provide an incredible capability to synthesize, understand, generate,  and distill information from  text, images, code and other data.  

The Everest Lab, from the MIT Data Systems Group, focuses on how "New AI", i.e., large language models (LLMs) and related generative AI technologies, will change how enterprises work with data.

Our key thesis is that these new AI applications need new systems.   We aim to rethink the way we not only build new experiences around data and data systems using LLMs but also address these new emerging areas in a more grounded way by developing new abstractions, principles, best practices, reusable components, and software tools. 

Our goal not to develop new foundation models (FMs) nor to improve the training or inference time of FMs, but to explore guiding principles and approaches to build novel AI-driven user experiences to operate data services, process, query, and visualize data, and build data-driven applications using this new technology. 

Here are some Everest projects:

- <a href="https://dsg.csail.mit.edu/projects/brad/">BRAD</a>, a system to automatically optimize cloud data infrastructure
- <a href="https://ppc.mit.edu/a2/">A2rchi</a>, an open-source RAG framework for AI support systems
- <a href="https://kramabench.org/">KramaBench</a>, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents
