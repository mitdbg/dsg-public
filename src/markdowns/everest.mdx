New foundation models like LLMs and other generative AI (GenAI) models provide an incredible capability to synthesize, understand, generate,  and distill information from  text, images, code and other data.  

The Everest Lab, from the MIT Data Systems Group, focuses on how "New AI", i.e., large language models (LLMs) and related generative AI technologies, will change how enterprises work with data.

Our key thesis is that these new AI applications need new systems.   While some of these topics are being addressed in industry, many recent efforts appear ad hoc and purely experimentally-driven (e.g., by testing a lot of different prompts). Except that they are built on large language models, little infrastructure is shared between the different use cases. We believe it's time to take a step back, rethink the way we not only build new experiences around data and data systems using LLMs but also address these new emerging areas in a more grounded way by developing new abstractions, principles, best practices, reusable components, and software tools. 

The goal of Everest is not to develop new foundation models (FMs) like LLaMA nor to improve the training or inference time of FMs, but to explore guiding principles and approaches to build novel AI-driven user experiences to operate data services, process, query, and visualize data, and build data-driven applications using this new technology. While we will not be able to address all challenges, we believe that we can build new approaches to accelerate the adaptation of AI for various data-focused tasks at hyperscalers and more traditional companies from banks to retailers.
