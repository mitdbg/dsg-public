The Data Systems Group (DSG) at MIT conducts research on all areas of data and information management. Projects range from the design of new user interfaces and query languages to low-level query execution issues, to the design of new systems for database analytics and main memory databases to query processing in next-generation pervasive and ubiquitous environments such as sensor networks, wide area information systems, personal databases, and the Web.

Below are some recent pictures of our group!
