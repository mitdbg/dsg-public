# ECCS: Exposing Critical Causal Structures

For data systems that support causal queries, high quality causal models are 
essential to more reliable query results. The golden standard for establishing 
causal models for scientific domain data is carefully designed experiments, often 
relying on interventions in a laboratory setting. However, interventional 
experiments can often be not plausible while building a causal model for 
custom domain data. Therefore, people rely on extracting models from observational 
data. Standard statistical causal discovery algorithms often do not scale to 
accomodate the number of variables and the volume of data in custom scenarios. Most 
causal discovery algorithms also cater to downstream tasks with more indirect 
measures of accuracy. In this project, we are interested in developing framework 
for interactively refine a causal model for such custom domain data systems. The 
framework aims to efficiently use itsinteractivity budget to minimize biases in 
given Average Treatment Effect (ATE) queries that the user is interested in.
