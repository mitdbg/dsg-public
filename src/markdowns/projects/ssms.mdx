summary: >
    Modern cloud developers face many distributed systems complexities when building
    disaggregated applications from cloud building blocks. We propose a new class of
    cloud services, called Serverless State Management Systems (SSMS), that abstracts away
    these complexities and transparently manages fault-tolerance, deployment, and scaling
    of a logical cloud application on physical cloud resources. An SSMS, analogous to a
    DBMS, provides three important abstractions for disaggregated applications: 1) a
    logical application model, similar to relational algebra, that describes application
    semantics but abstracts away the deployment details, 2) strong resilient programming
    primitives, similar to ACID transactions, that simplifies fault-tolerant programming
    in the cloud, and 3) smart, cost-based optimization schemes that automates scheduling,
    placement, and other details, similar to a query optimizer. SSMS is an overarching
    research direction that encapsulates several projects in cloud, distributed and
    concurrent systems.

# Serverless State Management Systems

Modern cloud developers face many distributed systems complexities when building
disaggregated applications from cloud building blocks. We propose a new class of
cloud services, called Serverless State Management Systems (SSMS), that abstracts away
these complexities and transparently manages fault-tolerance, deployment, and scaling
of a logical cloud application on physical cloud resources. An SSMS, analogous to a
DBMS, provides three important abstractions for disaggregated applications: 1) a
logical application model, similar to relational algebra, that describes application
semantics but abstracts away the deployment details, 2) strong resilient programming
primitives, similar to ACID transactions, that simplifies fault-tolerant programming
in the cloud, and 3) smart, cost-based optimization schemes that automates scheduling,
placement, and other details, similar to a query optimizer. SSMS is an overarching
research direction that encapsulates several projects in cloud, distributed and
concurrent systems. For more details, please check out each of the individual projects:
