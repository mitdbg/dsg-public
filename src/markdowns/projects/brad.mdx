summary: >
    The last decade of database research has led to the prevalence of specialized
    systems for different workloads. Consequently, organizations often rely on a
    combination of specialized systems, organized in a Data Mesh. Data meshes
    present significant challenges for system administrators, including picking the
    right system for each workload, moving data between systems, maintaining
    consistency, and correctly configuring each system. Many non-expert end users
    (e.g., data analysts or app developers) either cannot solve their business
    problems, or suffer from sub-optimal performance or cost due to this complexity.
    We envision BRAD, a cloud system that automatically integrates and manages data
    and systems into an instance-optimized data mesh, allowing users to efficiently
    store and query data under a unified data model (i.e., relational tables)
    without knowledge of underlying system details. With machine learning, BRAD
    automatically deduces the strengths and weaknesses of each engine through a
    combination of offline training and online probing. Then, BRAD uses these
    insights to route queries to the most suitable (combination of) system(s) for
    efficient execution. Furthermore, BRAD automates configuration tuning, resource
    scaling, and data migration across component systems, and makes recommendations
    for more impactful decisions, such as adding or removing systems. As such, BRAD
    exemplifies a new class of systems that utilize machine learning and the cloud
    to make complex data processing more accessible to end users, raising numerous
    new problems in database systems, machine learning, and the cloud.

# BRAD: Simplifying Cloud Data Processing with Learned Automated Data Meshes

The last decade of database research has led to the prevalence of specialized

present significant challenges for system administrators, including picking the

We envision BRAD, a cloud system that automatically integrates and manages data
