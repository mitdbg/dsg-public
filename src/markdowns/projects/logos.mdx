summary: >
   Causal inference can quantify cause-effect relationships in domains as varied as 
    medicine, economics and public policy. Production computer systems exhibit a 
    similar level of complexity, together with a recurring time-sensitive need to 
    diagnose unwanted phenomena. However, such systems are often only observed 
    imperfectly and indirectly, through long, messy, semi-structured logs. In this work, 
    we want to accelerate large systems debugging by applying causal inference over logs. 
    This will let engineers leverage logs to diagnose problems and assess interventions 
    in a principled manner. Our proposed framework achieves this through two 
    human-in-the-loop modules: (1) The Candidate Cause Ranker, through which engineers 
    can determine the causes of a problem without running a full causal discovery algorithm, 
    informing possible interventions; and (2) the Interactive Causal Graph Refiner, which 
    helps engineers compute an unbiased estimation of the effect of their discovered causes 
    without extensive manual causal graph verification. Both modules are powered by the 
    insight that only part of the causal graph of the system is needed to correctly quantify 
    an effect of interest. We also provide a data preparation pipeline, the Log Converter, 
    which transforms raw, messy, real-world logs into an appropriate tabular input for causal 
    inference, using methods drawn from data transformation, cleaning, and extraction.

# LOGos: From Logs to Causal Diagnosis of Large Systems

Causal inference can quantify cause-effect relationships in domains as varied as 
medicine, economics and public policy. Production computer systems exhibit a 
similar level of complexity, together with a recurring time-sensitive need to 
diagnose unwanted phenomena. However, such systems are often only observed 
imperfectly and indirectly, through long, messy, semi-structured logs. In this work, 
we want to accelerate large systems debugging by applying causal inference over logs. 
This will let engineers leverage logs to diagnose problems and assess interventions 
in a principled manner. Our proposed framework achieves this through two 
human-in-the-loop modules: (1) The Candidate Cause Ranker, through which engineers 
can determine the causes of a problem without running a full causal discovery algorithm, 
informing possible interventions; and (2) the Interactive Causal Graph Refiner, which 
helps engineers compute an unbiased estimation of the effect of their discovered causes 
without extensive manual causal graph verification. Both modules are powered by the 
insight that only part of the causal graph of the system is needed to correctly quantify 
an effect of interest. We also provide a data preparation pipeline, the Log Converter, 
which transforms raw, messy, real-world logs into an appropriate tabular input for causal 
inference, using methods drawn from data transformation, cleaning, and extraction.
